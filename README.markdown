##Overview

This module installs and sets up Razor.

##Dependencies

The Database should be postgres >= 9.1

Modules:
- puppetlabs/stdlib (REQUIRED)
- puppetlabs/postgresql (Optional)
  * puppetlabs/apt (postgresql)
  * puppetlabs/concat (postgresql)
- puppetlabs/vcsrepo (Optional)
- [https://github.com/lavaburn/puppetlabs-tftp.git] (Optional)
  * puppetlabs/xinetd (tftp)
- maestrodev/wget (Optional/tftp)
- [https://github.com/lavaburn/puppet-archive.git] (Optional)

* If you want to set up PostgreSQL config:
  	- `include 'posgresql::server'`	[puppetlabs/postgresql]
* If you want to compile the Microkernel (on Fedora/CentOS/RHEL)
	- puppetlabs/vcsrepo module 
* If you want to set up TFTP boot files
	- `include 'wget'`
	- `class { '::tftp': }`		[puppetlabs/tftp]
* If you want to download/extract a microkernel, 
	- Do not set microkernel_url to undef. (Default : puppetlabs precompiled)
	- lavaburn/archive module	
	
##Usage
     
It is highly recommended to put secret keys in Hiera-eyaml and use automatic parameter lookup
* [https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml]
* [https://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/1/puppet.html#automatic-parameter-lookup]

Make sure to include all dependencies as per above.

Also see the examples/profile.pp file for an example on how to set up dependencies.   
     
```
  class { 'razor':
    db_hostname => '127.0.0.1',
    db_password => 'notasecretpassword',
  } 
```

Unfortunately Puppet does not support autorequire for classes. Hence a dependency for each of the custom types must be set to Class['razor'].
`Class['razor'] -> razor_broker...`
```
razor_broker { 'name':
  require => Class['razor'],
  ...
}
``` 
```
Razor_repo { 
  require => Class['razor'],
  ...
}
``` 

Note: you will probably need to run it twice anyway as the razor server service is very slow to start.
API calls will only start working a few minutes after the service starting.
[suggestions welcome to fix that]


##Reference

You should only use the 'razor' class.

### Types

#### razor_broker
```
razor_broker { 'puppet-dev':
  ensure        => 'present',
  broker_type   => 'puppet',
  configuration => {
    'server'      => 'puppet',
    'environment' => 'dev'
  },
}
```
- name: The broker name
- ensure: The basic property that the resource should be in.
          Valid values are `present`, `absent`.
- broker_type: The broker type
- configuration: The broker configuration (Hash)
- provider: The specific backend to use for this `razor_broker` resource. 
            You will seldom need to specify this --- Puppet will usually
            discover the appropriate provider for your platform.
            Available providers are:
  * rest: REST provider for Razor broker

#### razor_policy
```
razor_policy { 'install_ubuntu_on_hypervisor':
  ensure        => 'present',
  repo          => 'ubuntu-14.04.1',
  task          => 'ubuntu',
  broker        => 'puppet-dev',
  hostname      => 'host${id}.test.com',
  root_password => 't3mporary',
  max_count     =>  undef,
  before_policy => 'policy0',
  node_metadata => {},
  tags          => ['small'],
}
```
- name: The policy name
- ensure: The basic property that the resource should be in.
          Valid values are `present`, `absent`.
- repo: The repository to install from
- task: The task to use to install the repo
- broker: The broker to use after installation
- hostname: The hostname to set up (use ${id} inside)
- root_password: The root password to install with
- max_count: The maximum hosts to configure (set nil for unlimited)
- after_policy: The policy after this one
- before_policy: The policy before this one
- node_metadata: The node metadata [Hash]
- tags: The tags to look for [Array]
- provider: The specific backend to use for this `razor_policy` resource. 
            You will seldom need to specify this --- Puppet will usually
            discover the appropriate provider for your platform.
            Available providers are:
  * rest: REST provider for Razor broker

#### razor_repo
```
razor_repo { 'ubuntu-14.04.1':
  ensure  => 'present',
  iso_url => 'http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04.1/ubuntu-14.04.1-server-amd64.iso',
  task    => 'ubuntu',
}
```
- name: The repository name
- ensure: The basic property that the resource should be in.
          Valid values are `present`, `absent`.
- iso_url: The URL of the ISO to download
- url: The URL of a mirror (no downloads)
- task: The default task to perform to install the OS
- provider: The specific backend to use for this `razor_repo` resource. 
            You will seldom need to specify this --- Puppet will usually
            discover the appropriate provider for your platform.
            Available providers are:
  * rest: REST provider for Razor broker

#### razor_tag
```
razor_tag { 'small':
  ensure => 'present',
  rule   => ['=', ['fact', 'processorcount'], '1']
}
```
- name: The tag name
- ensure: The basic property that the resource should be in.
          Valid values are `present`, `absent`.
- rule: The tag rule (Array)   
- provider: The specific backend to use for this `razor_tag` resource. 
            You will seldom need to specify this --- Puppet will usually
            discover the appropriate provider for your platform.
